# 1.Import the data in the form of csv file.
# 2. Clean the data - to remove duplicated data
# 3. Split the data into training / test sets
# 4. Create a model
# 5. Train the model - after create / build the algorithm
# 6. Make predictions - measure the predictions accuracy
# 7. Evaluate and improve

#python libraries
# 1. Numpy - multidimensional array
# 2. Pandas - data concept called data frame. Data frame is two dimensional data structure similar to an excel spreadsheet.
# 3.MatPlotLib - two dimensional plotting library for creating graphs on plots
# 4. Scikit-Learn - algorithms like decision tree n neural networks.

# For ideal ML, use jupyter to write codes (easy to inspect data),to install jupyter, use a platform anaconda.
